    description: "The pre-facelift first generation Kia Stinger (2018-2020 model years) introduced Kia's entry into the sports sedan market, featuring a rear-wheel drive platform developed under former BMW M executive Albert Biermann. The fastback liftback design was a departure for Kia, competing directly with established luxury performance sedans. Available engines included the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder Theta II producing 255 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 Lambda II generating 365 hp and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission, with rear-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive optional. The V6 model accelerated from 0-60 mph in approximately 4.6 seconds. Interior features included a driver-focused cockpit with a 7-inch infotainment screen, leather upholstery options, and available Harman Kardon audio system. The pre-facelift model was sold from 2018 to 2020 before receiving significant updates for the 2021 model year."

    description: "The facelifted Kia Stinger (2021-2023 model years) retained the same platform and overall design but received significant visual and mechanical updates. Exterior changes included revised headlights and taillights, with the rear gaining a full-width LED light bar. The interior upgraded to a new 10.25-inch infotainment screen and featured the new Kia logo for 2021 models. A new optional engine was added: the 2.5-liter Smartstream turbocharged four-cylinder producing 300 hp and 311 lb-ft of torque. The 3.3-liter V6 received a power increase to 368 hp while maintaining the same 376 lb-ft of torque. A variable exhaust system became available. The Stinger Tribute Edition was released in December 2022 to mark the end of production, limited to 1,000 units worldwide with exclusive Moonscape Gray matte color and terracotta brown leather interior. Production ended in April 2023 after successfully establishing Kia as a capable manufacturer of premium performance vehicles."
