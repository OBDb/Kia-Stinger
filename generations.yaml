    description: "The first and only generation of the Kia Stinger represented a significant departure for the brand, introducing a rear-wheel drive-based sports sedan designed to compete with established luxury performance vehicles. Developed under the leadership of former BMW M executive Albert Biermann, the Stinger featured a fastback design with a liftback rear hatch rather than a traditional trunk. Initially launched with either a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 255 horsepower or a 3.3L twin-turbocharged V6 making 365 horsepower (later increased to 368 hp in 2022), both engines were paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Available in rear-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations, the V6 model could accelerate from 0-60 mph in under 5 seconds. The interior offered a driver-focused cockpit with premium materials, a standard 7-inch (later 10.25-inch) infotainment screen, and available luxury features including Nappa leather, heated and ventilated seats, and a 15-speaker Harman Kardon audio system. The Stinger received a mid-cycle refresh for 2022 with updated exterior styling, new taillights with a full-width LED light bar, and enhanced interior materials. Despite critical acclaim for its driving dynamics, value proposition, and practicality, sales remained modest throughout its production run. In 2023, Kia announced the discontinuation of the Stinger, ending production after this single generation, though the model had successfully served its purpose as a brand-elevating halo vehicle that helped reshape perceptions of Kia as a maker of premium performance cars."
